# Authentication Form Customization

## 🔐 Overview

The agent2_ingestor application uses AWS Amplify's Authenticator component with custom form field configurations to improve user experience.

## ✅ Current Customizations

### Field Label Changes:
- **Username → Email Address**: Both Sign In and Create Account forms now show "Email Address" instead of "Username"
- **Placeholder Text**: Updated to "Enter your email address" for clarity

### Implementation:
```typescript
const formFields = {
  signIn: {
    username: {
      placeholder: 'Enter your email address',
      label: 'Email Address',
    }
  },
  signUp: {
    username: {
      placeholder: 'Enter your email address',
      label: 'Email Address',
    }
  }
};
```

## 🎯 User Experience Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Users understand they should enter their email address
2. **Consistency**: Matches the Cognito configuration that uses email for authentication
3. **Reduced Confusion**: Eliminates the ambiguity of what "username" means in this context

## 🚀 Deployment Status

- ✅ **DEV**: Updated and deployed (https://dev.dn1hdu83qdv9u.amplifyapp.com)
- 📋 **Next**: Deploy to TEST and MAIN environments when ready

## 🔧 Additional Customization Options

The Amplify Authenticator supports many other customizations:

### Password Requirements Display:
```typescript
formFields: {
  signUp: {
    password: {
      label: 'Password',
      placeholder: 'Enter your password',
      isRequired: true,
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Validation Messages:
```typescript
formFields: {
  signUp: {
    email: {
      label: 'Email Address',
      placeholder: 'Enter your email',
      isRequired: true,
      order: 1
    }
  }
}
```

### Form Field Ordering:
Add `order` property to control field sequence.

## 📝 Notes

- The underlying Cognito configuration still uses email as the username attribute
- This customization only affects the UI labels and placeholders
- The form validation and authentication logic remain unchanged
