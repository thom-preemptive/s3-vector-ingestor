# S3 Bucket Segregation Implementation

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Issue:** All environments (dev, test, main) were showing the same processed documents  
**Root Cause:** Shared S3 bucket and manifest.json file across all environments  
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED

---

## Problem Summary

When testing the three environments (dev, test, main), the "Processed Documents" table showed identical data across all environments. Documents processed in DEV appeared in TEST and MAIN, even though no documents had been processed in those environments.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Shared S3 Bucket:** All environments used `agent2-ingestor-bucket-us-east-1`
2. **Single Manifest File:** All environments read/write to the same `manifest.json`
3. **No Data Isolation:** Documents, sidecars, and manifest were shared across environments

This was a critical data isolation issue that violated the principle of environment segregation.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment-Specific S3 Buckets

Created three separate S3 buckets with proper isolation:

```
agent2-ingestor-bucket-dev-us-east-1
agent2-ingestor-bucket-test-us-east-1
agent2-ingestor-bucket-main-us-east-1
```

Each bucket is configured with:
- âœ… CORS enabled for web access
- âœ… Versioning enabled for document history
- âœ… Server-side encryption (AES-256)
- âœ… Proper permissions for Lambda access

### 2. Template Changes

**File:** `backend/template.yaml`

**Before:**
```yaml
S3_BUCKET: agent2-ingestor-bucket-us-east-1
```

**After:**
```yaml
S3_BUCKET: !Sub 'agent2-ingestor-bucket-${Environment}-us-east-1'
```

This uses CloudFormation's `!Sub` function to dynamically substitute the environment name.

### 3. Infrastructure Script

**File:** `infrastructure/create_environment_buckets.sh`

Created an automated script to:
- Create all three S3 buckets
- Configure CORS policies
- Enable versioning
- Set up encryption
- Apply consistent settings across environments

### 4. Data Migration

Migrated existing data from the shared bucket to the dev bucket:
```bash
aws s3 sync s3://agent2-ingestor-bucket-us-east-1/ \
            s3://agent2-ingestor-bucket-dev-us-east-1/
```

**Result:** 19 files migrated (documents, sidecars, manifest, uploads)

### 5. Bucket Initialization

Created empty manifest.json files for test and main environments:

**File:** `infrastructure/initialize_bucket_structure.sh`

This script:
- Creates properly formatted empty `manifest.json` files in test and main buckets
- Documents that folders (documents/, sidecars/, uploads/) are created automatically by S3
- Ensures each environment has a valid starting state

**Result:**
- Test bucket: Empty manifest.json (0 documents)
- Main bucket: Empty manifest.json (0 documents)
- Dev bucket: Populated manifest.json (6 documents)

---

## Deployment Summary

### Backend Deployments

All three backend stacks were redeployed with environment-specific S3 bucket configuration:

| Environment | Stack Name | API Gateway ID | Status |
|------------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **dev** | agent2-ingestor-backend-dev | l798gl73t0 | âœ… UPDATE_COMPLETE |
| **test** | agent2-ingestor-backend-test | 0s6jkdc680 | âœ… CREATE_COMPLETE |
| **main** | agent2-ingestor-backend-main | 8u92zsiqmj | âœ… CREATE_COMPLETE |

### API Endpoints

Each environment now has its own API Gateway endpoint:
- **Dev:** `https://l798gl73t0.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev`
- **Test:** `https://0s6jkdc680.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/test`
- **Main:** `https://8u92zsiqmj.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/main`

### Git Operations

Changes committed and merged across all branches:

```bash
Commit: d875725
Message: "fix: Implement environment-specific S3 buckets for data isolation"
Branches: dev â†’ test â†’ main
```

---

## Complete Environment Isolation

With this fix, all three environments now have complete data isolation:

### Per-Environment Resources

| Resource Type | Dev | Test | Main |
|--------------|-----|------|------|
| **DynamoDB - Jobs** | agent2_ingestor_jobs_dev | agent2_ingestor_jobs_test | agent2_ingestor_jobs_main |
| **DynamoDB - Approvals** | agent2_ingestor_approvals_dev | agent2_ingestor_approvals_test | agent2_ingestor_approvals_main |
| **DynamoDB - Tracking** | agent2_ingestor_user_tracking_dev | agent2_ingestor_user_tracking_test | agent2_ingestor_user_tracking_main |
| **S3 Bucket** | agent2-ingestor-bucket-dev-us-east-1 | agent2-ingestor-bucket-test-us-east-1 | agent2-ingestor-bucket-main-us-east-1 |
| **Cognito User Pool** | us-east-1_Yk8Yt64uE | us-east-1_T4apZJIeL | us-east-1_mLiHR7DqI |
| **API Gateway** | l798gl73t0 | 0s6jkdc680 | 8u92zsiqmj |

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify Data Isolation

**Dev Environment:**
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://agent2-ingestor-bucket-dev-us-east-1/
# Should show: 19 files (existing documents)
```

**Test Environment:**
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://agent2-ingestor-bucket-test-us-east-1/
# Should show: 0 files (empty)
```

**Main Environment:**
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://agent2-ingestor-bucket-main-us-east-1/
# Should show: 0 files (empty)
```

### 2. Test Document Processing

1. **Dev Environment:**
   - Upload a document named "Dev Test Document"
   - Verify it appears in dev "Processed Documents"
   - Verify it does NOT appear in test or main

2. **Test Environment:**
   - Upload a document named "Test Environment Document"
   - Verify it appears in test "Processed Documents"
   - Verify it does NOT appear in dev or main

3. **Main Environment:**
   - Upload a document named "Main Production Document"
   - Verify it appears in main "Processed Documents"
   - Verify it does NOT appear in dev or test

### 3. Verify Manifest Isolation

Each environment should have its own manifest.json:

```bash
# Dev manifest
aws s3 cp s3://agent2-ingestor-bucket-dev-us-east-1/manifest.json - | jq '.documents | length'

# Test manifest (should be empty or not exist)
aws s3 cp s3://agent2-ingestor-bucket-test-us-east-1/manifest.json - | jq '.documents | length'

# Main manifest (should be empty or not exist)
aws s3 cp s3://agent2-ingestor-bucket-main-us-east-1/manifest.json - | jq '.documents | length'
```

---

## Expected Outcomes

âœ… **Dev environment** shows 6 processed documents (migrated from shared bucket)  
âœ… **Test environment** shows 0 processed documents (empty)  
âœ… **Main environment** shows 0 processed documents (empty)  
âœ… New documents processed in each environment stay isolated  
âœ… No cross-environment data leakage  
âœ… Each environment maintains its own manifest  

---

## Files Modified

1. **backend/template.yaml**
   - Changed S3_BUCKET from hardcoded to environment-aware using `!Sub`

2. **infrastructure/create_environment_buckets.sh** (NEW)
   - Automated script to create and configure all three S3 buckets
   - Configures CORS, versioning, and encryption

---

## Technical Details

### CloudFormation Substitution

The `!Sub` function dynamically replaces `${Environment}` with the actual parameter value:

- When `Environment=dev` â†’ `agent2-ingestor-bucket-dev-us-east-1`
- When `Environment=test` â†’ `agent2-ingestor-bucket-test-us-east-1`
- When `Environment=main` â†’ `agent2-ingestor-bucket-main-us-east-1`

### Lambda Environment Variables

Each Lambda function now receives the correct S3 bucket name:

```python
bucket_name = os.getenv('S3_BUCKET')
# dev:  'agent2-ingestor-bucket-dev-us-east-1'
# test: 'agent2-ingestor-bucket-test-us-east-1'
# main: 'agent2-ingestor-bucket-main-us-east-1'
```

### S3 Service Automatic Handling

The `S3Service` class automatically uses the environment-specific bucket:

```python
class S3Service:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bucket_name = os.getenv('S3_BUCKET', 'agent2-ingestor-bucket-us-east-1')
        # Reads environment-specific bucket name from Lambda env vars
```

No code changes needed in the service layer - environment awareness is handled via environment variables.

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, to rollback to shared bucket (NOT recommended):

1. Revert template.yaml:
   ```yaml
   S3_BUCKET: agent2-ingestor-bucket-us-east-1
   ```

2. Redeploy all three stacks:
   ```bash
   sam build
   sam deploy --parameter-overrides Environment=dev --stack-name agent2-ingestor-backend-dev
   sam deploy --parameter-overrides Environment=test --stack-name agent2-ingestor-backend-test
   sam deploy --parameter-overrides Environment=main --stack-name agent2-ingestor-backend-main
   ```

3. Revert git commit:
   ```bash
   git revert d875725
   git push origin dev test main
   ```
