# ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED ✅

## The Problem
After running the diagnostic page, we discovered the real issue:

**Environment Variable Issue**: The `REACT_APP_API_URL` in Amplify was set to the placeholder value `"https://your-api-url"` instead of the actual backend API endpoint.

## Diagnostic Results Showed:
```
Test 4: Backend Health Check
Cannot reach backend
{
  "error": "Failed to fetch",
  "url": "https://your-api-url/health"  ← WRONG URL!
}
```

## Why This Happened
- Local `.env` file had the correct URL: `https://pubp32frrg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`
- But **Amplify uses its own environment variables** configured in the Amplify Console
- When Amplify was initially set up, the `REACT_APP_API_URL` variable was never added
- So the code fell back to using a placeholder value from `index.tsx`

## The Fix Applied

Set the correct environment variable in Amplify:

```bash
aws amplify update-branch \
  --app-id dn1hdu83qdv9u \
  --branch-name dev \
  --environment-variables '{
    "REACT_APP_API_URL": "https://pubp32frrg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev",
    "REACT_APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID": "us-east-1_Yk8Yt64uE",
    "REACT_APP_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID": "6hcundvt29da9ap8ji973h1pqq",
    "REACT_APP_AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",
    "REACT_APP_AMPLIFY_ENV": "dev",
    "CI": "true",
    "GENERATE_SOURCEMAP": "false",
    "TSC_COMPILE_ON_ERROR": "true",
    "ESLINT_NO_DEV_ERRORS": "true"
  }' \
  --region us-east-1
```

**Deployment #39** is now building with the correct environment variables.

## What Will Work After This Deployment

1. ✅ **Backend connectivity**: API calls will reach the correct endpoint
2. ✅ **Authentication**: JWT tokens will be sent to the real backend
3. ✅ **Upload documents**: Will return real job IDs (UUIDs) instead of "mock-" prefixed IDs
4. ✅ **Jobs page**: Will display actual jobs from DynamoDB
5. ✅ **All authenticated endpoints**: /jobs, /upload/pdf, /process/urls, etc.

## Why We Went in Circles Before

Previous attempts focused on:
- ❌ Token retrieval methods (but token was fine - 1086 chars)
- ❌ API response formats (backend was correct)
- ❌ CORS configuration (not the issue)
- ❌ Code changes to fix authentication flow

**None of these were the problem** because the frontend couldn't even reach the backend!

The diagnostic tool saved us by identifying the exact issue immediately.
