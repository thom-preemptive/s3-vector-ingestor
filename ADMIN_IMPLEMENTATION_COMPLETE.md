# Admin Role Implementation Summary

## 1. Overview
- **Initiative name**: Admin Role-Based Access Control
- **Goal / user benefit**: Enable administrators to manage DEV/TEST environments with clear tables/buckets functionality and comprehensive user management
- **Feature type**: Feature
- **Scope level**: Major
- **Owner/DRI**: Development Team

## 2. Context & Constraints
- **Related threads/docs**: Copilot instructions requiring TypeScript strict mode, AWS us-east-1 region
- **Assumptions**: 
  - DEV/TEST environments allow destructive operations
  - MAIN environment completely blocked from destructive operations
  - 2-3 global admins managed manually via Cognito custom:role attribute
- **Non-goals**: Complex role hierarchy, automated role assignment

## 3. Requirements
- **Functional requirements**:
  - Admin users can clear DynamoDB tables in DEV/TEST only
  - Admin users can clear S3 buckets in DEV/TEST only
  - Admin users can view all user accounts
  - Admin users can access system-wide analytics
  - Environment safety prevents destructive operations in MAIN
- **Non-functional requirements**:
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - Environment-specific resource segregation
  - Proper error handling and confirmation dialogs
- **Security & compliance considerations**:
  - JWT token validation with Cognito custom:role attribute
  - Environment-based access control
  - Dual confirmation for destructive operations

## 4. Design Summary
- **API/Schema**: 
  - Admin endpoints: `/admin/clear-buckets`, `/admin/clear-tables`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/system-analytics`
  - Admin decorators: `get_admin_user`, `get_admin_user_with_environment_check`
- **Data Model**: Cognito custom:role attribute with value 'admin'
- **Services**: Enhanced S3Service, DynamoDBService, CognitoService with admin methods
- **UX notes**: Settings page with admin-only sections, confirmation dialogs with checkboxes

## 5. Implementation Steps âœ… COMPLETED

### Backend Implementation âœ…
1. **Admin Decorators** - Added authentication decorators in `backend/main.py`
   - `get_admin_user()` - Validates custom:role = 'admin'
   - `get_admin_user_with_environment_check()` - Adds environment safety for destructive ops

2. **Admin Endpoints** - Added four admin endpoints in `backend/main.py`
   - `POST /admin/clear-buckets` - Clear S3 buckets (DEV/TEST only)
   - `POST /admin/clear-tables` - Clear DynamoDB tables (DEV/TEST only)
   - `GET /admin/users` - List all users in system
   - `GET /admin/system-analytics` - Get comprehensive system analytics

3. **Service Methods** - Enhanced AWS services in `backend/services/aws_services.py`
   - **S3Service**: `clear_environment_buckets()`, `get_total_document_count()`, `get_total_storage_usage_gb()`
   - **DynamoDBService**: `clear_environment_tables()`, `get_total_job_count()`, `get_job_count_by_status()`
   - **CognitoService**: `list_all_users()`, `get_user_count()`, `get_active_users_count()`, `get_new_users_count()`

### Frontend Implementation âœ…
1. **Admin Hook** - Created `frontend/src/hooks/useAdminRole.ts`
   - TypeScript interface for admin permissions
   - Environment-based permission checking
   - JWT token parsing for custom:role attribute

2. **Clear Buckets Component** - Created `frontend/src/components/ClearBucketsButton.tsx`
   - Material-UI button with confirmation dialog
   - Dual checkbox confirmation system
   - Environment display and safety messaging
   - API integration with proper error handling

3. **Settings Page Enhancement** - Updated `frontend/src/components/SettingsPage.tsx`
   - Three admin-only sections: Database & Storage, User Management, System Analytics
   - Environment-aware UI rendering
   - Navigation to admin pages
   - Integration with useAdminRole hook

## 6. Testing Strategy
- **Unit**: Service method validation completed âœ…
- **Integration**: Admin endpoint definition validation completed âœ…
- **E2E**: Ready for testing with actual Cognito admin tokens
- **Security tests**: Environment safety validation implemented âœ…

## 7. Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin examples)

```gherkin
Feature: Admin Role Access Control

Scenario: Admin user can clear buckets in DEV environment
  Given I am an admin user with custom:role="admin"
  And the environment is "dev"
  When I click "Clear All Buckets" in Settings
  And I confirm both checkboxes in the dialog
  Then all DEV environment buckets should be cleared
  And I should see a success message

Scenario: Admin user cannot clear buckets in MAIN environment
  Given I am an admin user with custom:role="admin" 
  And the environment is "main"
  When I view the Settings page
  Then the "Clear All Buckets" button should not be visible
  And I should see "MAIN Environment - Destructive operations disabled"

Scenario: Non-admin user cannot access admin features
  Given I am a regular user without admin role
  When I view the Settings page
  Then I should not see any admin-only sections
  And admin navigation options should be hidden
```

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Accidental data deletion in MAIN
  - **Mitigation**: Multiple environment checks, MAIN completely blocked
- **Risk**: Unauthorized admin access
  - **Mitigation**: JWT token validation, Cognito custom:role attribute

## 9. Rollout Plan
- **Env progression**: Deploy to DEV â†’ Test admin functionality â†’ Deploy to TEST â†’ Deploy to MAIN
- **Feature flag timeline**: No flags needed, role-based access inherent
- **Monitoring during ramp**: CloudWatch logging for admin operations

## 10. Rollback & Recovery
- Admin functionality is additive, no breaking changes
- Can disable by removing custom:role attribute from admin users
- Clearing operations are environment-specific and reversible via backups

## 11. Cost & Performance Impact
- Minimal impact: Additional endpoints and UI components
- Admin operations are infrequent and manual
- No impact on regular user workflows

## 12. Definition of Done âœ…

### Completed Criteria:
- âœ… Backend admin decorators implemented with proper JWT validation
- âœ… Admin endpoints defined with environment safety checks  
- âœ… AWS service methods added for clearing and analytics operations
- âœ… Frontend admin components created with TypeScript strict mode
- âœ… Admin role checking hook implemented with environment awareness
- âœ… Settings page enhanced with admin-only sections
- âœ… Confirmation dialogs with dual checkboxes for destructive operations
- âœ… Environment segregation enforced (DEV/TEST allow, MAIN blocks)
- âœ… Code validation passed all tests
- âœ… Follows all copilot-instructions.md standards

### Next Steps for Full Deployment:
1. Configure Cognito custom:role attribute for admin users
2. Set ENVIRONMENT and REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT variables in deployment
3. Test with actual admin user tokens in DEV environment
4. Deploy and validate clearing operations work correctly

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Files Modified/Created:

- `backend/services/aws_services.py` - Enhanced with admin methods
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAdminRole.ts` - New admin permission hook
- `frontend/src/components/ClearBucketsButton.tsx` - New admin component
- `frontend/src/components/SettingsPage.tsx` - Enhanced with admin sections

### Environment Variables Required:
- `ENVIRONMENT` (backend) - Controls destructive operation permissions
- `REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT` (frontend) - Controls UI admin feature visibility

### Security Model:
- JWT token validation with Cognito custom:role attribute
- Environment-based operation restrictions
- Dual confirmation for destructive operations
- Admin-only endpoint protection with 403 errors for non-admins

The admin role implementation is **COMPLETE** and ready for deployment testing! ðŸš€
